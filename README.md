This project provisions a virtual machine (VM) with minimal specifications and implements an automated scheduling system to start and stop the VM at predefined times on specific days of the week. 
The scheduling is managed using Google Cloud Functions and Cloud Scheduler to optimize resource usage and cost efficiency.
